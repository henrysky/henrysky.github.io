## About Me!

{{< centered_img source_path="assets/img/pro_big.jpg" alttext="About Me" maxwidth="800">}}

Hello, I am Henry. I’m a Senior AI Scientist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and recently completed my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. My doctoral research boardly focused on applying deep learning methodologies including Transformers and Denoising Diffusions to large-scale astronomical datasets. A significant part of my work involved developing and using Foundation Models for scientific applications, particularly in the analysis of large-scale astronomical data in the future.

I’m also passionate about open-source software development. On GitHub, I maintain several widely-used projects designed to make training neural net models for certain applications in astronomy easy. All of my research are open-source and also available online. You can check it out at [My Codes]({{< ref "codes" >}}) as well as my [Github profile](https://github.com/henrysky).

In my free time, I enjoy astrophotography, where I combine my technical expertise with my love for the night sky.
